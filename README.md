# Weather-Prediction-using-ML

"Weather Prediction using Machine Learning" is a project that harnesses the power of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and Naive Bayes, to accurately forecast weather conditions. By analyzing extensive historical weather data encompassing key factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, the project aims to develop robust predictive models capable of anticipating weather patterns over time. Through the application of advanced machine learning techniques such as regression and time-series analysis, these models seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of weather predictions. Such improvements hold significant implications for decision-making across various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, and disaster preparedness, by providing timely and precise insights into forthcoming weather conditions.
